    <p> This interface was built by the company, Toast. It is stationed in many 
        restaurants and coffee shops, used by customers to finalize their order payment of.
         It is structured like a mini iPad, facing the customer, directly in front
        of the cash-reigster's computer. This specific interface is at Ceremony Tea in Providence. 
        After a user orders from the cash register worker, the tip screen I drew above will appear. 
        It asks them how much tip they would like to include and for a signature. 
        This finalizes their order so that they can pay and get what they would like!  </p>
