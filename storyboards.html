                        with her laptop, ready for a productive day completing research work and 
                        prepping for an exam!

                        Waiting in line as a customer finishes their order ahead of her, Carrie 
                        checks her emails on her phone. She has a busy day ahead, trying to save 
                        as much time for herself as possible.

                        Carrie tells the Ceremony cafe employee the order which she would like. 
                        She orders a lavender latte with oat milk, her go-to Ceremony drink.

                        The Ceremony cafe worker begins to make Carrie’s lavender latte as Carrie 
                        completes the toast payment system’s questions. She selects a custom tip 
                        amount of $2.00, her regular chosen amount no matter what she orders.

                    <body>
                        Because Carrie has a membership with toast, her credit card number 
                        automatically associates with her email, so she does not need to type 
                        it out in order to earn stars. Carrie is excited that she earned 5 stars, 
                        which will go to a drink discount soon.

                        Carrie gets her coffee after 4 minutes, and sits down with it at a table at 
                        Ceremony. She enjoys the drink for the next hour as she works.
