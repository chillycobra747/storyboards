<div  class="container">
    <h4 class="header">User One</h4>
    <p> The first user of the interface clicked around each of the tip options a few times. They paused, 
        looked back at the screen, then finally clicked the “no tip” button. Their signature was very short, 
        only a small squiggly line, before they pressed continue and quickly walked away. There is a second 
        screen after “continue,” which asks for the user’s signature. User 1 walked away before they saw 
        that this screen even appeared.  </p>
</div>

<div  class="container">
    <h4 class="header">User Two</h4>
    <p> The second user pressed a custom tip immediately after looking at the screen. They clicked a 
        custom tip, quickly typed in $1.00. After clicking the “continue” button, the second screen, 
        rather than asking for the user’s email address, already had that section populated (i.e. User 
        2’s email was already automatically entered). User 2 pressed “next” and the screen showed that 
        they earned 6 stars! User 2 smiled, said “thank you” to the cash register worker and walked away.   
    </p>
</div>

<div  class="container">
    <h4 class="header">User Three</h4>
    <p> The third user clicked the 20% tip button, pressed “continue” then asked the cash register worker 
        whether they should enter their email or not. The cash register worker explained the purpose of entering 
        an email (ability to make a membership with Ceremony, then earn stars, which will culminate to 
        discounts on drinks). User 3 smiled, said “thanks, cool, I will sign up.” After attempting to type 
        in their email with one hand, User 3 set down the phone and wallet they were holding, typed out 
        their email, and pressed “next.”

            overall experience with the interface. </li>
